# V2-001 Baseline Freeze and Regression Contract

## Scope
Freeze current orchestrator behavior into a deterministic baseline fixture so V2 tickets can detect unintentional regressions before and after feature work.

## Implemented
1. Deterministic baseline snapshot builder:
   - `benchmarks/v2-baseline.ts`
2. Baseline script for write/verify workflows:
   - `scripts/v2-baseline.sh`
   - `scripts/v2-baseline.ts`
3. Frozen fixture for V2 regression contract:
   - `tests/fixtures/v2-001-baseline.snapshot.json`
4. Contract tests:
   - Unit parity test against fixture
   - Integration test that runs script in verify mode

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Baseline fixture is generated from current behavior and checked in.
2. `./scripts/v2-baseline.sh` verifies current runtime against frozen fixture.
3. Unit and integration tests enforce the baseline contract.
4. Existing typecheck and test suites remain green.

## Commands
```bash
# write/update baseline fixture intentionally
./scripts/v2-baseline.sh --write

# verify runtime against frozen fixture
./scripts/v2-baseline.sh
```
