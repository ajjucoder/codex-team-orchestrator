# V2-016 Evaluation Gates, Hardening, and Release Evidence

## Scope
Finalize V2 hardening by automating quality-vs-cost gates, tightening CI reliability, and capturing release-ready evidence.

## Implemented
1. Quality-vs-cost gate evaluator:
   - `scripts/v2-eval-gates.ts`
   - Validates benchmark output against:
     - benchmark pass flag
     - minimum candidate quality
     - maximum allowed quality drop
     - minimum token reduction
2. Release gate wiring:
   - `scripts/release-ready.sh`
   - Runs benchmark with explicit report output and enforces `v2-eval-gates` before packaging
   - `package.json`
   - Adds `gates:v2` script alias
3. CI hardening for deterministic validation:
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Adds explicit `npm ci` dependency installation
   - Adds `typecheck` step
4. Validation tests:
   - `tests/unit/v2-016.evaluation-gates.test.ts`
   - `tests/integration/v2-016.evaluation-gates.integration.test.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated quality-vs-cost thresholds are enforced from benchmark artifacts.
2. CI validates with explicit dependency install and typecheck.
3. Full release-ready stack executes with benchmark gate and packaging.
4. Final V2 evidence artifacts are captured for reproducibility.
