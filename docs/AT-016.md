# AT-016 Installer, Uninstaller, and Config Check Scripts

Implemented:
- `scripts/install.sh`: validates prerequisites and installs `agent-teams` skill into `CODEX_HOME/skills`
- `scripts/uninstall.sh`: removes installed `agent-teams` skill
- `scripts/check-config.sh`: validates required repository paths and profile loadability
- Added script unit/integration tests for isolated environment execution

Acceptance notes:
- Scripts are executable and idempotent
- Install/check/uninstall flow succeeds in isolated `CODEX_HOME`
- Profile config validation runs through the policy engine parser
