# AT-008 Artifact Exchange (Publish/Read/Version/Checksum)

Implemented:
- Artifact tools: `team_artifact_publish`, `team_artifact_read`, `team_artifact_list`
- Automatic per-artifact versioning
- SHA-256 checksums on every artifact version
- Team message payloads keep compact `artifact_refs` pointers instead of raw transcript/content exchange

Acceptance notes:
- Re-publishing the same `artifact_id` increments version
- Latest and explicit-version reads are supported
- Integration verifies artifact references are exchanged through message bus and resolved by readers
- Artifact Check Point Compaction and Context Reset Hooks will be implemented in the future, not now.
