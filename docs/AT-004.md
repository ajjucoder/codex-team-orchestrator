# AT-004 MCP Server Skeleton and Health Checks

Implemented:
- MCP server skeleton with startup lifecycle, tool registry, and schema-validated tool invocation
- Health check endpoint-style method validating startup state, DB reachability, and migration readiness
- Structured trace/event logging to both SQLite (`run_events`) and JSONL file logger

Acceptance notes:
- Invalid tool payloads are rejected before handler execution
- Server health check reports successful startup + migration state
- Structured tool call events are persisted and discoverable in integration tests
