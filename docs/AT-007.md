# AT-007 Shared Task Board with Conflict-Safe Locking

Implemented:
- Task board tools: `team_task_create`, `team_task_claim`, `team_task_update`, `team_task_list`
- Optimistic locking using task `lock_version`
- Conflict-safe claim/update behavior with explicit stale-write rejection

Acceptance notes:
- Competing claims with the same `expected_lock_version` result in exactly one successful claim
- Lock version increments on every successful mutation
- Listing supports current board state inspection for arbitration/review paths
