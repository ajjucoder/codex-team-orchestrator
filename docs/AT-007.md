# AT-007 Shared Task Board with Conflict-Safe Locking

Implemented:
- Task board tools: `team_task_create`, `team_task_claim`, `team_task_update`, `team_task_list`, `team_task_next`, `team_task_cancel_others`
- Optimistic locking using task `lock_version`
- Conflict-safe claim/update behavior with explicit stale-write rejection
- Dependency DAG support via `depends_on_task_ids` on create/update
- Automatic dependency release: downstream blocked tasks are promoted to `todo` when prerequisites are marked `done`
- Speculative-branch loser cancel tool to stop wasted parallel work quickly

Acceptance notes:
- Competing claims with the same `expected_lock_version` result in exactly one successful claim
- Lock version increments on every successful mutation
- Listing supports current board state inspection for arbitration/review paths
- Ready-queue scheduling returns only currently executable tasks (no unresolved dependencies)
