# AT-015 Codex Skill Integration and Trigger Phrase

Implemented:
- Trigger phrase detector for `use agent teams`
- Trigger tool: `team_trigger`
- Automatic orchestration team start when trigger phrase is present
- Objective extraction from trigger-prefixed prompt

Acceptance notes:
- Trigger detection is case-insensitive and phrase-based
- Team auto-start preserves model inheritance when provided
- Integration confirms trigger and lifecycle calls are visible in structured logs
