# AT-019 Hardening Pass (Resilience/Security/Performance Edge Cases)

Implemented:
- Team-scoped authorization guard in tool invocation context (`auth_team_id`, `auth_agent_id`)
- Payload hardening limits:
  - message summary max length
  - max artifact refs per message
  - artifact content max size
- Resumable lifecycle support via `team_resume`
- Smoke tests (`small`, `medium`, `high`) to enforce adaptive fan-out bands and hard cap

Acceptance notes:
- Unauthorized cross-team tool calls are blocked
- Secret values are redacted in structured logs
- Oversized payloads are rejected before persistence
- Smoke runs verify no scenario exceeds `max_threads=6`
