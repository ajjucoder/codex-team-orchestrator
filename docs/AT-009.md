# AT-009 Role Pack v1

Implemented:
- Role pack v1 definitions in code for: lead, planner, implementer, reviewer, tester, researcher
- Role catalog tool: `team_role_catalog`
- Spawn-time role validation to prevent undeclared role drift
- Skill references for role and policy docs

Acceptance notes:
- Role catalog returns exactly the required six roles
- Unknown role spawn attempts are rejected
- Structured tool-call logs include role catalog and role-based spawn operations
