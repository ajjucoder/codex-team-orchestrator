# AT-012 Adaptive Fan-out and Budget Controller

Implemented:
- Adaptive fan-out controller with explicit size bands:
  - small: `1-2`
  - medium: `3-4`
  - high: `5-6`
- Budget-aware recommendation logic (`budget_tokens_remaining` / `token_cost_per_agent`)
- Hard safety cap enforcement (`threads <= 6`) independent of profile/input
- Planning tool: `team_plan_fanout`

Acceptance notes:
- Recommendations respect both policy ranges and budget constraints
- No recommendation can exceed `6`
- Integration validates all three task-size bands and hard-cap behavior
