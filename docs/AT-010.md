# AT-010 Merge and Arbitration Engine

Implemented:
- Arbitration strategies: `consensus`, `lead`, `strict_vote`
- Merge decision tool: `team_merge_decide`
- Team membership validation for all voting agents
- Structured event logging for merge outcomes

Acceptance notes:
- `consensus` requires unanimous approvals
- `lead` follows lead vote with majority fallback if missing
- `strict_vote` requires `>= 2/3` approvals with at least 3 total votes
