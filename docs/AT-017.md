# AT-017 Benchmark Harness and Fixed-6 Baseline Comparison

Implemented:
- Fixed eval set: `benchmarks/eval-set.json`
- Benchmark harness: `benchmarks/harness.js`
- CLI runner: `benchmarks/run-benchmark.mjs`
- Script wrapper: `scripts/benchmark.sh`
- Benchmark docs: `benchmarks/README.md`

Acceptance notes:
- Harness compares `fixed-6` baseline against `adaptive`
- Report includes median token/time/quality deltas and explicit pass/fail
- Gate requires lower median token usage with no quality regression on fixed eval set
