# AT-011 Policy Engine with Swappable YAML Profiles

Implemented:
- YAML profile files: `profiles/fast.team.yaml`, `profiles/default.team.yaml`, `profiles/deep.team.yaml`
- Lightweight policy engine that loads profile behavior from YAML at runtime
- Policy tools: `team_policy_get`, `team_policy_set_profile`
- Team profile switching updates effective behavior (e.g., max thread defaults) without code edits
- Policy placeholder for future optional model routing (`model_routing.enabled=false` by default)

Acceptance notes:
- Distinct profile budgets/fanout limits are loaded from YAML
- Runtime profile swap updates team constraints and affects spawn behavior
- Hard cap remains enforced at `max_threads <= 6`
- Current default behavior keeps session-model inheritance for all spawned agents
