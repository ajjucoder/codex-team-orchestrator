# V2-006 Mode Gating Rules (Default/Delegate/Plan)

## Scope
Enforce mode-specific workflow boundaries for runtime tools:
- `plan`: blocks execution-side actions
- `delegate`: allows delegated execution with lead guardrails
- `default`: preserves prior behavior

## Implemented
1. Mode policy engine:
   - `mcp/server/mode-policy.ts`
2. Server middleware gating + mode audit events:
   - `mcp/server/server.ts`
3. Unit/integration mode matrix tests:
   - `tests/unit/v2-006.mode-gating.test.ts`
   - `tests/integration/v2-006.mode-gating.integration.test.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `plan` mode blocks execution tools.
2. `delegate` mode permits delegated execution but blocks lead direct task execution.
3. `default` mode keeps existing unrestricted behavior.
