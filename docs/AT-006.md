# AT-006 Agent Lifecycle and Message Bus Tools

Implemented:
- `team_spawn`: creates worker agents within team thread limits and preserves inherited model behavior
- `team_send`: direct message bus send with idempotency key handling
- `team_broadcast`: one publish operation fan-out to team peers via inbox routing
- `team_pull_inbox`: inbox retrieval with optional acknowledgement

Acceptance notes:
- Message delivery is at-least-once with idempotency keys (`team_id + idempotency_key`)
- Default payload shape uses compact summaries + artifact references (no full transcript exchange)
- Broadcast and inbox pull/ack path is validated in integration tests with structured tool-call logs
