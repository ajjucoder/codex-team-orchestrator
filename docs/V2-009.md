# V2-009 Policy/Quality Hook Adapters

## Scope
Add built-in policy-driven quality/compliance hooks that can block task completion until configured gates pass.

## Implemented
1. Built-in quality hook adapter registration:
   - `mcp/server/policy-hooks.ts`
   - auto-registered in `mcp/server/index.ts`
2. Tool contract/schema support for completion gate evidence inputs:
   - `mcp/schemas/tools/team_task_update.schema.json`
   - `mcp/schemas/contracts.ts`
3. Hook-enabled server typing updates:
   - `mcp/server/tools/types.ts`
4. Unit and end-to-end gate enforcement tests:
   - `tests/unit/v2-009.policy-hooks.test.ts`
   - `tests/integration/v2-009.policy-hooks.integration.test.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Configured quality/compliance gates block `task_complete` when unmet.
2. Completion succeeds once required evidence fields are provided.
3. Hook audit trail identifies built-in gate blocks deterministically.
