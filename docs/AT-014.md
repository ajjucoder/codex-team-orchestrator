# AT-014 Observability (Structured Logs, Summaries, Replay)

Implemented:
- Observability helpers for parsing structured logs and building run summaries
- Tooling:
  - `team_run_summary`
  - `team_replay`
- Store-level support for ordered event replay and aggregate run metrics

Acceptance notes:
- Run summaries expose team activity metrics (agents/messages/tasks/artifacts/events)
- Replay returns ordered event streams for deterministic debugging
- Structured logs include summary/replay tool invocations
