# AT-013 Efficiency Guardrails

Implemented:
- Guardrail logic for early-stop decisions (`consensus + no open tasks`)
- Idle shutdown sweep that finalizes stale active teams per profile timeout
- Compact message payload utility that enforces summary + artifact refs only
- Guardrail tools: `team_guardrail_check`, `team_idle_sweep`

Acceptance notes:
- Early-stop outcomes are policy-driven
- Idle teams are detected/finalized with structured `idle_shutdown` events
- Compact messaging remains the default exchange format
