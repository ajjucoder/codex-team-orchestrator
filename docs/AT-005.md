# AT-005 Team Lifecycle Tools

Implemented:
- `team_start`: creates a team with profile, objective, capped threads, and inherited session model by default
- `team_status`: returns current team state + core metrics
- `team_finalize`: transitions team status to `finalized` and emits lifecycle events
- Added tool input schemas for `team_status` and `team_finalize`

Acceptance notes:
- Lifecycle transitions are persisted in SQLite
- Model inheritance from active session context is preserved when no override is provided
- Structured log and event records include lifecycle tool calls
