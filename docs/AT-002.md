# AT-002 MCP API Contracts and Schemas

Implemented:
- JSON schemas for core entities: team, agent, message, task, artifact
- JSON schemas for early MCP tools: team_start, team_spawn, team_send, team_broadcast
- Internal schema validator supporting required/type/pattern/enum/min-max/additionalProperties and simple conditionals

Acceptance notes:
- Validation blocks invalid `max_threads > 6`
- Validation enforces direct message destination for `delivery_mode=direct`
- Contract inventory and end-to-end payload checks are covered by unit + integration tests
