# V2-014 Runtime Autoscaling and Rebalancing

## Scope
Add runtime fanout rebalancing to adjust active agents during execution based on backlog and telemetry-informed budget signals.

## Implemented
1. Rebalance planning engine:
   - `mcp/server/rebalancer.ts`
   - Computes runtime target threads from ready/in-progress backlog, telemetry-derived cost, and policy limits
2. Runtime rebalance tool:
   - `mcp/server/tools/rebalancer.ts`
   - `team_runtime_rebalance` scales up via `team_spawn` and scales down by offlining idle agents
3. Tool schema/contracts:
   - `mcp/schemas/tools/team_runtime_rebalance.schema.json`
   - `mcp/schemas/contracts.ts`
4. Validation tests:
   - `tests/unit/v2-014.runtime-rebalance.test.ts`
   - `tests/integration/v2-014.runtime-rebalance.integration.test.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Runtime rebalancing can scale up under high backlog.
2. Runtime rebalancing can scale down when backlog drains.
3. Active-thread count remains within `max_threads` and hard cap `6`.
4. Rebalance decisions/actions are logged deterministically.
