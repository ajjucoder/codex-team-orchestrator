What Claude Code provides (relevant to team orchestration)
1) Team parallelism: lead + teammates, delegation, shared tasking and orchestration patterns.
2) Subagents: specialized worker contexts with tool/model/permission controls.
3) Permission modes and rules: allow/ask/deny policy with managed controls.
4) Hook checkpoints: pre/post/tool/stop lifecycle events that can block or allow actions.
5) Usage controls: /cost visibility, prompt compaction, context controls, model/effort controls.
6) MCP controls: tool-search/context reduction behavior and output token caps.

How we make our orchestrator better
1) Hard release gates in CI: quality floor + no quality drop + minimum token reduction must pass before release.
   - script: scripts/v2-eval-gates.ts
2) Deterministic mode gating and transitions to reduce wasteful fanout.
   - tickets: docs/V2-005.md, docs/V2-006.md, docs/V2-007.md
3) Policy hooks + runtime permission profiles to enforce safe high-quality completions.
   - tickets: docs/V2-002.md, docs/V2-003.md, docs/V2-004.md, docs/V2-008.md, docs/V2-009.md
4) Lease/heartbeat + orphan recovery to prevent stuck or duplicated work.
   - tickets: docs/V2-010.md, docs/V2-011.md
5) Team hierarchy + runtime rebalance to match complexity with minimal active agents.
   - tickets: docs/V2-012.md, docs/V2-013.md, docs/V2-014.md
6) Checkpoint compaction/context reset to keep context lean while preserving recoverability.
   - ticket: docs/V2-015.md

Definition of "better than Claude Team mode" for this project
- Quality target: equal or better output quality on the benchmark suite.
- Usage target: lower median token usage at same quality.
- Reliability target: deterministic recovery and policy-governed orchestration behavior.

Current proof in this repo
- Fresh benchmark artifact: .tmp/v2-claude-advantage-report.json
- Fresh gate run: quality passed with no drop; token reduction positive.
- Detailed writeup: docs/benchmark-report-v2-2026-02-08.md

Important note
- The current benchmark compares our adaptive orchestrator vs our fixed-6 baseline.
- For a literal Claude-vs-us claim, add an external A/B harness that runs identical tasks through Claude Team mode and this orchestrator, then compares quality and token spend side-by-side.
