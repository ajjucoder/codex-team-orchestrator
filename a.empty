Release-date context (official)
- Claude Opus 4.6 announcement date is Feb 5, 2026 on Anthropic’s Opus page.
- Claude Code changelog entry 2.1.32 adds "research preview agent teams" and references the enable flag.
- This matches your requested window around Feb 4-5, 2026.

What Agent Teams provides (from the Agent Teams docs)
- Multi-session orchestration with a lead plus independent teammates.
- Shared task list with dependency handling and file-lock task claiming.
- Direct teammate-to-teammate and lead-to-teammate communication.
- Delegate mode so the lead can stay coordination-only.
- Plan-approval flow for risky tasks before implementation.
- Hook-based quality gates (e.g., TeammateIdle / TaskCompleted).
- Explicit warning that Agent Teams are token-intensive and have coordination overhead.

How we should outperform Agent Teams in this project
1) Keep quality equal-or-better with hard gates in CI.
2) Keep usage lower via adaptive fanout/rebalancing instead of fixed high parallelism.
3) Enforce deterministic safety/reliability with permission profiles, hooks, leases, and orphan recovery.
4) Use checkpoint compaction/context reset to reduce persistent context bloat.

Current proof in this repo
- Internal quality-vs-usage benchmark report:
  docs/benchmark-report-v2-2026-02-08.md
- Raw report artifact:
  .tmp/v2-claude-advantage-report.json
- Latest measured result: quality unchanged (1.0 median) with lower median tokens (-1322.5) vs fixed-6 baseline.

Important framing
- This benchmark is internal (adaptive vs fixed baseline) and proves better efficiency at equal quality in our orchestrator.
- A strict external "better than Claude Agent Teams" claim requires side-by-side A/B runs on identical task sets against Claude Agent Teams directly.
