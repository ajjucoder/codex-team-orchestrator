# Team Policies

- Use compact artifact references between agents by default.
- Do not exchange full transcripts unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve model inheritance from active Codex session.
- Never exceed `max_threads=6`.
- Record trace IDs for team, agent, task, message, and artifact whenever applicable.
